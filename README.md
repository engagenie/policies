# Lapsly Terms and Policies

This repository contains the various terms and policies used by [Lapsly](https://www.lapsly.com) providing a historical record of changes and planned future changes.

# HOWTO: Open source your company's policies

1. [Create your own repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) named _policies_ or [fork ours](https://github.com/engagenie/policies/fork).

2. Add your current policies to the repository:

- Include your Terms of Service, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other policy documents that relate to schools, students, and teachers using your service.
- Protip: The [HTML to Markdown](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) converter makes it easy to generate plain text versions of your existing policies.

3. Use Git branches and Pull Requests to manage changes in your policies.

4. Let everyone know by tweeting your repository with the hashtag [#opensourceprivacy](https://twitter.com/search?q=opensourceprivacy&src=typd)
