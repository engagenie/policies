# Lapsly Privacy Policy

_Last Modified: October 30, 2019 (changes to go into effect November 30, 2019)_

Lapsly is designed for use in schools, and we are committed to the highest standards of protection for student data and personally identifiable information (“PII”) at all times. In addition to this Privacy Policy, we also comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), and applicable state laws. In addition, Lapsly has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/).

This Privacy Policy explains how Engagenie, Inc., ("**_we_**" or “**_Lapsly_**”) use, protect, and disclose the information we collect when you use the Lapsly services (the “**_Services_**”) through our website [www.Lapsly.com](http://lapsly.com) (“**_Site_**”), [Web Application](https://app.lapsly.com), [Lapsly Google Chrome Extension], through APIs, and through third parties. A “**_Device_**” is any computer used to access the Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.

Users in the European Union, please read our statement on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [here](https://github.com/engagenie/policies/blob/master/gdpr-statement.md).

_Changes to this Privacy Policy_

We manage changes to this Privacy Policy via [this public repository](https://github.com/engagenie/policies) hosted on GitHub.com. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy with respect to how we collect and use your personal information, we will provide at least 30 days’ prior written notice to you by email to the email address specified in your account, if you have one, so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change, and you can choose to opt-out by revoking Google or Microsoft Permission to your Lapsly account before the change takes effect. **IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.**

- Email Address (associated with a Google Account),

For questions about your Personal Information on our Services, please contact privacy@engagenie.com.

### Usage Data

In addition, when you use our Services, the following types of information may all be logged automatically ("**_Usage Information_**"):

- Type of mobile device you use,

- Operating system of your mobile device,

- Browser type,

- Date and time stamps associated with transactions.

Usage data will only be combined with personal data when required to solve a specific problem you have encountered while using our Services and have requested support in solving the problem.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use your information to determine general, non-identifying demographics like location (down to the city level), age range (e.g. 25-35), and equipment profiles (e.g. Chromebook with medium-size screen).

We use this demographic information:

- to provide and improve our Services

- to administer your use of our Services

- to better understand your future needs from our Services

- to personalize and improve your experience

- to provide or offer software updates and product announcements

- to enhance current, and develop new, products and services

If you submit Personal Information to us, we will only use it for the purpose you requested or for which it is collected or for any **educational** purpose you subsequently authorize. Lapsly will never sell your information or use it to build to marketing profile.

_Please see the section [Our Policy Towards Children](our-policy-toward-children) for specific information on how we use data from users identified as students._

## HOW WE COLLECT USAGE DATA

Lapsly collects some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of our Services, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for our Services to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google BigQuery to track anonymous usage across all users. We use Google Analytics to track usage of our public website at [https://lapsly.com](https://lapsly.com). Google Analytics Privacy Policy can be viewed at [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/). Information on opting out of Google Analytics can be found [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)

We store all of our data on Google Cloud Platform.

_Please see the section [Our Policy Towards Children](our-policy-toward-children) for specific information on how we collect usage data from users identified as students._

## DATA OWNERSHIP

All data remains the property of and is solely owned, and thereby controlled, by you. You grant Lapsly a non-exclusive, royalty free license, to use equipment, software, your data or other material of yours solely for the purpose of providing, maintaining, and supporting you and other licensees with Lapsly Products and Services. However, Lapsly may use and distribute the data for any lawful purpose outside the scope of the Agreement, provided always that such Data must be de-identified.

## ACCESS & CORRECTING ERRONEOUS DATA

Under FERPA, a school must provide a parent, teacher or school administrator with an opportunity to inspect and review his or her child’s education records within 45 days following its receipt of a request. A school is required to provide a parent with copies of education records, or make other arrangements, if a failure to do so would effectively prevent the parent from obtaining access to the records.

Requests to review student data from parents, teachers, and administrators may be directed to privacy@engagenie.com. In the event there is any erroneous data contained in the student record, Lapsly will advise parents, legal guardians, and eligible students to contact the school to update their information in their Google user profile.

## DATA TRANSFER

User Content may be transferred from Lapsly by sharing files or folders from your Google Drive. Google also provides a tool called Takeout that allows you to export and transfer all data at one time (see: https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).

## PAYMENT INFORMATION

If you provide credit card or debit card information to complete a purchase, it is our policy to use third-party payment processing systems that comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is an industry wide security standard designed to protect the confidentiality and security of your credit card information, by encryption using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and storage with AES-256 encryption.

Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards. Your credit card information will also be subject to our payment processor’s privacy policy in addition to ours. As of the date this policy went into effect, Lapsly uses Stripe [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) for payment processing.

If you wish to dispute a charge by mail or telephone please contact us at support@lapsly.com. Lapsly complies with all legal requirements of your State’s applicable laws regarding providing refunds for unauthorized charges. When you make a charge, we shall display a completed charge screen. This is your electronic receipt. You should print or save this electronic receipt for your records. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY TRANSACTION.

## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Further, you agree that Lapsly may transfer the anonymous information we collect in the event of any corporate restructuring or any sale, assignment or transfer of substantially all of its rights in the Apps to an entity which has signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/). You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer of your information.

We may disclose information about you if we become subject to a subpoena or court order, or if we are otherwise legally required to disclose information. We may also use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to enforce the Terms of Use, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or User Content, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.

Lapsly will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on our Services according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account. Through certain features of our Services, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.

**Service Providers, Business Partners and Others**. Lapsly may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve our Services (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, email communication, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf. We only contract with Third Parties whose Privacy Practices _(including security and data retention)_ are in adherence with the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/privacy-pledge/). As of the date this policy went into effect, we use:

Service Providers used for business functions:

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to perform personalized email communication (only for teacher users who have opted into receiving email communication from Lapsly.)

- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) to analyze and report usage data.

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to collect and report subscription data for premium users. (only for teacher users who have purchased a premium subscription)

Service Providers used for the technical infrastructure of our application:

- Google's Cloud Platform and Google Drive to store some of your information (for example, your User Content)

- Firebase.com to store some of your information (for example, course enrollments, names and student responses)

**Non-private or Non-Personal Information**. Lapsly may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Services. However, in such cases, your usage data is aggregated with the usage data of others and does not identify you individually.

## DELETING YOUR INFORMATION

To delete your account using Google, please remove the Lapsly application from your [Google Drive Permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1) and delete your Lapsly user content from your Google Drive.

## LINKED SITES

Our Services may contain links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Lapsly. If you submit personal Information to any of those sites, your Information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.

## SECURITY

Lapsly takes reasonable steps to help protect Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. All personal data are stored on- and secured with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can read more about GCP's security practices [here](https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/whitepaper).

Our employees are granted access to personal data stored in our GCP account though a secure sign-in process. Employees' access to user data is only granted to Employees when it is necessary to perform one of the functions listed in the section HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION. Employees receive training on data security and need to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits them from storing any user data outside of GCP (e.g. on their local devices) before being granted access to any user data. Once an employee leaves the company their access to user data is immediately removed.

We require our employees to take reasonable steps to secure their devices to prevent unauthorized access to user data through saved GCP logins. This includes a requirement for securing their devices with strong passwords, and encrypting the device storage.

**Lapsly expressly disclaims any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to offering any definitive promise of security in connection with the anonymous information we collect.**

## OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN

We will never collect, use, share, or sell any behavioral information of users identified as students beyond the authorized educational or school purposes, or as authorized by the student or parent.

We will never permit any information collected through our Services to be used to provide behaviorally targeted advertising towards users identified as students by us or a 3rd party.

We will never display advertising of any kind to users identified as students on our Services.

We are required under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from Children. COPPA allows the Child’s School to obtain consent for the online collection of personal information from Children who are students of the School.

If a Child wants to use our Service, he/she must first obtain an Account from his/her School. Before an Account is provided to a School, we require that the School (on behalf of the Parent) (a) consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of the Child, through the Service, in accordance with this Children’s Privacy Policy, and (b) agree that the Child’s online activities are subject to the Terms of Service.

As required under COPPA, we allow Parents certain choices regarding the personal information submitted by their Children Parents should make any permitted requests with the School and have the School, as the Parent’s agent, pass on those requests to Lapsly. We may rely on the instructions that we receive from the School that we reasonably believe are given by a Child’s Parent to the School. For example, if a representative from the Child’s School contacts us and provides the Account information we request, we may assume that the person calling is acting on behalf of the Child’s Parent.

We provide Parents the following choices with respect to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of Personal Information. A Child’s registration information is always accessible to him/her. A Parent has the right to review her Child’s Personal Information, which the Parent can obtain by contacting her Child’s School. After reviewing the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may ask us to update or delete the Child’s Personal Information by requesting such changes through the Child’s School. A Parent may prohibit us from sharing a Child’s Personal Information with a third party by requesting such prohibition through the Child’s School. Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Child’s Personal Information with third parties for the Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes (each as described above).

If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Child’s Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Child’s Personal Information through the School. Upon receiving such request from the Child’s School, we will delete the Child’s Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account. Lapsly will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the Account or related deletion of the Child’s Personal Information. When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.

## DATA LOCATION

If you reside outside the U.S., the information we collect will be transferred to the U.S. and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By using the Services and providing Information to Lapsly, you consent to the use, transfer and processing of the anonymous information we collect as set forth in this Privacy Policy, all of which activities will take place in the U.S.

## DATA RETENTION

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services. When your account is deleted, all information associated with your account is deleted from our Services. This data is permanently removed from all live and backup systems within 180 days of your account being deleted.
